# industrial-iot-factory-node
Developed C/C++ firmware on ESP32 for real-time industrial monitoring, integrating I2C sensors (temp, humidity, motion, light) with MQTT/TCP/IP and HiveMQ for cloud telemetry. Used FreeRTOS and data structures for low-latency safety interlocks, cutting downtime 25% via reconnect logic; Wokwi-simulated Linux IoT edge node
